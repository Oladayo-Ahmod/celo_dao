# Overview

CELODAO  is a platform that enables decentralized governance and operation of organizations that is built on CELO blockchain. It allows users to become stakeholders by contributing a certain amount of resources.

Stakeholders within the DAO have the ability to raise proposals, which are then voted upon by other stakeholders. The voting period for each proposal is stipulated to be 5 minutes.

Once the voting period ends, payment is made to the beneficiary by the deployer(address) if the number of upvotes exceeds the number of downvote.

However, it's important to note that only the deployer account has the authority to process payments within the DAO.

It is important to note that, nobody can make proposal unless they are stakeholders. 

# Functionality

The DAO provides the following functionality:

- Stakeholder Contributions: Users can contribute a specified amount to become stakeholders within the DAO.
- Proposal Creation: Stakeholders can raise proposals for consideration by the DAO community.
- Voting: Stakeholders are able to vote on proposed initiatives during the stipulated voting period of 5 minutes.
- Payment Processing: After the voting period concludes, if a proposal receives more upvotes than downvotes, payment is processed to the designated beneficiary. This payment processing function is exclusively handled by the deployer account.
